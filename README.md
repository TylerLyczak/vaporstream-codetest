Overview
---
* All in `kotlin`
* Refactored `MainActivity` and `ResultsActivity` to use `ViewModel`, `Databinding`, and `LiveData`
* Using `MVVM`
* Added `input validation` for the EditTexts so submit is only enabled when they are correct
* Used `Room` to store the users data
* Can see all the data when the user click `See Data` button, brings you to DataActivity
* Used `workerthreads` for Room database when storing
